Manages Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network operations for Federated Learning.

This module contains the P2PHandler class responsible for managing peer-to-peer network interactions
in a federated learning setup. It includes functionality for initializing the network, publishing and
subscribing to messages (including model weights), and maintaining a record of peer statuses.

Classes:
    P2PHandler: Manages the P2P network interactions.

Example:
    # Initialization with network parameters
    p2p_handler = P2PHandler(bootnodes, key_path, topic, packet_size)
